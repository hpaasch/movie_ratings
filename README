While the assignment is complete, I ended up running each table data migration
separately. I need to better understand why. I had all three migration functions
in one migration file, but only the first one migrated. So then I intentionally
migrated the remaining two by sending them one at a time.

I also noticed this afternoon that my colleagues are doing a lot less typing
by using index instead of keys to access data. The keys are friendlier to read
but less typing is also attractive. Is this just personal preference or is there
a recommended practice?

I was stumped for a long, long time on the correct approach for bringing the
foreign keys into the ratings migration. And, yes, the answer was in my notes
from this morning. Assign the foreign key value to a variable and then use the
variable to create the new entry.
